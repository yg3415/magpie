## Built-in subscriptions that a plugin serves

Some built-in subscriptions are deprecated. Reaching them can break their
vendors' terms, so they are moving out of magpie into community OpenCode
plugins, which keeps magpie itself from being banned. Each one has a plugin
that does the same job:

| Subscription | id | Plugin (npm) | Mover |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command Code | `commandcode-plan` | `@magpie-community/opencode-commandcode-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_side.go` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `@magpie-community/opencode-cursor-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_side.go` |
| Devin | `devin` | `@magpie-community/opencode-devin-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_side.go` |
| Factory | `factory` | `@magpie-community/opencode-factory-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_factory.go` |
| Grok | `grok` | `@magpie-community/opencode-grok-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_side.go` |
| Kiro | `kiro` | `@magpie-community/opencode-kiro-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_kiro.go` |
| Xiaomi MiMo | `mimo-app` | `@magpie-community/opencode-mimo-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_mimo.go` |
| Qoder, Qoder CN | `qoder`, `qoder-cn` | `@magpie-community/opencode-qoder-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_qoder.go` |
| WorkBuddy, WorkBuddy AI | `workbuddy`, `workbuddy-ai` | `@magpie-community/opencode-workbuddy-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_workbuddy.go` |
| ZCode | `zcode` | `@magpie-community/opencode-zcode-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_zcode.go` |
| Zed | `zed` | `@magpie-community/opencode-zed-auth` | `internal/provider/migrate_zed.go` |

The `movers` map in `internal/provider/migrate*.go` is the source of truth.
`TestMovedBuiltinsSayTheirPlugin` fails when a mover has no notice in its
code.

### Which code actually runs

Two cases decide it:

- **Moved:** the user moved the subscription onto its plugin, from the
  editor's "Move to plugin" (or `provider.Adopt`). Its `migrations.json`
  state is `plugin` (`provider.Moved(id)`). A new user never sees a
  deprecated built-in: the Add sheet leaves one with no account out
  (`unusedSub` in app.js), so it is installed from the Plugins page. A user
  who installs the plugin themselves is moved too
  (`provider.HandOver`): at once when the built-in has no accounts, from the
  gateway's hourly loop (`KeepRetiringMoved`) when it has, unless they moved
  back or the plugin is signed in under its own `-plugin` id already. Until
  then the Add sheet shows the plugin's tile only (`replacedSub` in app.js).
- **Not moved:** the user is still signed in through the built-in.

For a moved subscription, the plugin does everything: sign-in, refresh,
models, requests, usage and errors. It runs in the plugin host
(`internal/plugin`). The built-in's code in `internal/provider/<name>*.go`,
`internal/gateway/<name>.go`, `internal/zed` and `internal/qoder` doesn't run
for it at all. The gateway sends its requests to the plugin's fetch, not to
the built-in's translator.

So a bug report about one of these subscriptions is usually about the
plugin:

1. Check whether the user's subscription is moved. A moved provider's row in
   `/api/providers` has `move.state == "plugin"`; the provider id is in
   `onPlugins`.
2. Fix the plugin in the community repo,
   [magpie-community/plugins](https://github.com/magpie-community/plugins)
   (`packages/<name>`, provider id = the built-in's id; checked out locally
   at `~/workspace/projects/magpie-commuity-plugins`). Publish a new version.
3. Raise the mover's `min` to that version. `keepMovedCurrent` then updates
   every moved user's plugin.
4. Make the same fix in the built-in only if it should also reach users who
   haven't moved. A fix made only in the built-in does nothing for moved
   users.

This magpie-side code still runs for moved subscriptions:

- the plugin host: `internal/plugin`, `host.js`;
- `internal/provider/plugins.go`, `plugin_usage.go` (`movedCards`) and
  `pluginsignin.go`;
- the move itself: `internal/provider/migrate*.go`;
- the GUI's plugin paths in `internal/gui/assets/app.js`: `subOf`,
  `pluginSubs` and `startPluginSignIn`.

A test against the built-in alone doesn't prove anything for moved users. To
compare the two, use the parity tests: `internal/gateway/plugin_*_test.go`.
