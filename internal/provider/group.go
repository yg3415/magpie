package provider

// Routing groups: several models, from one provider or many, that an agent
// picks as one. The gateway serves a group's id like any model's and
// routes each request over every member's keys or accounts together — a
// subscription whose allowance renews soonest first across providers, one
// resting after a failure last — rather than over one provider's.
//
// The user makes groups, in the Routing view. magpie also finds some on
// its own: a model more than one provider serves under the same name is a
// group of those, derived each time and never stored until the user
// changes one. Models of different names are only ever grouped by the
// user — in a group of their own, or by saying in a provider's Names &
// levels that one is the same as another (settings' ModelSameAs): nothing
// here guesses which models are alike beyond how vendors spell one id.
//
// A group's member may be another group ("group/<id>"): to the group it is
// one member, which a rule can put first like a model; its models are its
// own group's, ordered by its own routing and rules. A group can't be in
// itself, however deep: SaveGroup refuses the loop, and one written into
// providers.json by hand is cut where it closes.
