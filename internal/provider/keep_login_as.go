// Keeping Codex or Claude Code signed in to an account of the user's
// choosing (#524). Making an account first did two things at once: the
// gateway tries it first, and the agent is signed in to it. Kept on the
// first (KeepLogin), magpie only stopped moving the sign-in on. But the
// first is often just the account whose allowance is to be spent first,
// not the one the user uses the agent as: KeepLoginAs keeps the agent
// signed in to that one, wherever it stands in the order, and the order —
// which a drag or Make first sets — is the gateway's alone.
