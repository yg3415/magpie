// Signing Codex or Claude Code in to the next of its accounts when the one
// it is on has used its allowance up. Codex's requests on its own models go
// through magpie while more of its accounts are on there, and move on to
// the next account when one is out — but the Codex app, once it knows the
// account it is signed in to is out, may not send at all, so no request
// reaches magpie to move on. Claude Code on its own models never comes
// through magpie: it asks Anthropic as the account it is signed in to, and
// that account being out ends its turns with "You've hit your session
// limit" while the gateway has long moved on to another (#208). So
// whichever magpie runs the gateway signs the agent in to the next account
// that is on and has room, as switching it on the Accounts page would: a
// session started after that is on it from the first turn.
//
// It moves at the share Smart routing counts an account spent at, so the
// account the agent is signed in to and the one the gateway goes to agree
// on which is out (#209): the sign-in follows Smart; Smart doesn't follow
// the sign-in. In order, the gateway goes to the first until it is used
// up or refused, so the sign-in moves only once it is used up (#530).
//
// The account it moved from is the one the user made first, and it stays
// that: once it is no longer low (backShare) the agent is signed back in
// to it, as Smart gives it requests again then (#408). A switch the user
// makes meanwhile ends that. With KeepLogin on the subscription, the agent
// stays signed in to the first, whatever it has left (#524); with
// KeepLoginAs, to that account, wherever it stands in the order.
