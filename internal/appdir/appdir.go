// Package appdir decides where magpie keeps its own files: the one place
// every other package asks (#508).
//
// Installed, that is ~/.config/magpie ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/magpie) for what
// magpie keeps and ~/.cache/magpie ($XDG_CACHE_HOME/magpie) for what it
// can fetch again, as it always was. Portable, when a folder named "data"
// (or a file named ".portable") sits beside magpie, everything magpie
// keeps goes into that data folder, its caches into data/cache and the
// Windows webview's profile into data/webview2 (no Start-menu shortcut or
// App Paths entry is made either), and
// nothing of magpie's own is written to the user's profile, the way VS
// Code's portable mode works. "Beside magpie" is the folder holding the
// executable, with links followed; for a Mac app it is the folder holding
// Magpie.app (a file put inside the bundle would break its signature), and
// for an AppImage the folder holding the .AppImage file, not the folder it
// is mounted at while it runs.
//
// What isn't magpie's own stays where its owner reads it: the agents'
// configs (~/.claude, ~/.codex…), the sign-ins they keep in the system
// keychain, the folders the OS reads for autostart and link handling, and
// temporary folders.
//
// The decision is made once, from the executable as it was when magpie
// started: an update moving the running copy aside (into .magpie-update on
// a Mac, to magpie.exe.old on Windows) leaves it running from somewhere
// else, and its files must not move with it.
