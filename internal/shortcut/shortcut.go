// Package shortcut puts magpie in the Start menu on Windows. There it is
// one exe with no installer, so nothing else would: the first start of the
// desktop app makes a Magpie shortcut in the user's Start menu opening the
// exe it runs as, and Windows search finds it by that. It is made once:
// magpie remembers it did, and a shortcut the user deleted stays deleted
// (#508); one still there is pointed at the exe again when that was moved.
// A portable magpie (a data folder beside it) makes none and registers
// nothing, leaving no trace on the machine. Elsewhere it does nothing —
// the Mac has the app in Applications, Linux its own ways.
