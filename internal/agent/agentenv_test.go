// TestFolderVarsAreListed says every variable the packages that find an
// agent's folder read is one a sandbox clears. Nothing said so before, so a
// new agent could take a variable of its own and every sandbox would go on
// meeting the agent a developer really has installed — which is how #522 came
// about, four sandboxes clearing lists of their own that had each drifted.
//
// The five packages are this one, sessions, provider, library and gateway:
// every agent's folder variable magpie reads is read in one of them, and the
// rest of the repository reads only magpie's own variables, the process' and
// the desktop's. Their sources are read as files rather than imported, since a
// test in sessions or provider cannot import this package, which imports
// them; what the walk looks at is what they say, not what they do.
//
// What this cannot see is a variable read through a name the sources build at
// runtime, as omoDir reads OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR and SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR
// out of a slice, or through a constant (const fooEnv = "FOO_HOME" and then
// os.Getenv(fooEnv)). Both are in agentenv.Vars; a third taken either way
// would not be caught here.
