// T3 Code (pingdotgg/t3code, a GUI that drives Claude Code, Codex, Cursor
// and others; KevinXC on Discord) keeps its settings in
// ~/.t3/userdata/settings.json ($T3CODE_HOME/userdata), a sparse JSON file
// its server watches and reloads on an outside edit. Each provider it lists
// is an instance of a driver, and besides the built-in ones (keyed by the
// driver, "claudeAgent", "codex", …) it takes instances of one's own:
//
//	{"providerInstances":{"<id>":{"driver":"claudeAgent","displayName":…,
//	  "enabled":true,"environment":[{"name":…,"value":…,"sensitive":false}],
//	  "config":{"customModels":[{"slug":…,"name":…,"capabilities":
//	    {"optionDescriptors":[{"id":"effort","type":"select",…}]}}]}}}}
//
// A claudeAgent instance runs Claude Code (Anthropic's Agent SDK, the
// user's ~/.claude settings read as Claude Code reads them) with the
// instance's environment added, and lists Claude's models and its custom
// models, each sent as Claude Code's model. So magpie is an instance of its
// own, "magpie": Claude Code pointed at the gateway (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and
// the token Claude Code is routed with, so its requests are Claude Code's
// to the gateway, tiers and all), every magpie model one of its custom
// models, a 1M one marked [1m] as magpie marks it for Claude Code, with
// a Reasoning pick of the levels it takes and a Thinking switch
// (t3Capabilities). It is
// magpie's alone: the user's own instances, their custom models and T3's
// other keys stay as they are, and off takes only it out. A binary path or
// Claude home the user gave T3's own Claude is carried over, so it runs the
// same Claude Code. T3's Codex lists what Codex's model/list says, which is
// magpie's catalog once Codex is routed through magpie, so it needs nothing.
//
// The settings environment (~/.claude/settings.json's env) is applied over
// the process', so a Claude Code routed elsewhere in its own settings
// takes its requests there; one routed through magpie or not routed at all
// asks the gateway.
