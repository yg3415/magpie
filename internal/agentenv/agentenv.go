// Package agentenv names the environment variables through which an agent
// really installed on this machine reaches magpie: the one list a test
// sandbox clears, so that a test meets only the agents it put there itself.
//
// A sandbox fakes magpie's own folders through HOME, USERPROFILE and the XDG
// variables (appdir decides those), and an agent's folder through the
// variable that agent's own CLI reads before it falls back to its folder in
// the home: CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CODEX_HOME, QODER_CONFIG_DIR and the rest.
// Any one of them left over from the developer's shell points magpie at a
// real agent, whose sessions and settings a test then reads — and, where
// magpie writes what it wires, writes into (#522). Qoder's CLI sets both of
// its variables for every child it starts, and magpie manages Qoder, so
// writing magpie from inside Qoder was one way to meet this.
//
// Each package keeps its own sandbox, because a test in internal/sessions
// cannot import internal/agent, which imports it, to ask which variables
// there are; this is the list they all clear. A name here is one magpie
// reads, and TestVarsAreRead says so, so a variable magpie stopped reading
// does not linger — that is how GEMINI_CLI_HOME and OPENCODE_CONFIG came to
// be cleared by a sandbox while OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR, the one magpie reads,
// was not. What is deliberately not here: APPDATA and LOCALAPPDATA, Windows'
// folders rather than an agent's, which a sandbox sets to a folder of its
// own instead of clearing; and CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC, a
// behaviour flag whose one test sets it on purpose to read what magpie then
// does.
