// Affinity: a conversation stays with the key or account that answered it,
// so that what the vendor cached of it — the whole conversation so far, on
// every request — is read again rather than sent afresh to someone else
// and paid for in full. Routing still decides who goes first when nobody
// has answered yet, and whenever the one that did is resting or all but
// used up.
//
// How long it stays is the provider's or group's affinity: for the whole
// session; within a turn only — while the agent sends tool results back,
// until the user speaks again; never; or, by default, worked out from the
// conversation itself: within a turn always, and across turns while what
// the vendor said it read from its cache the last time is worth keeping
// and not yet gone cold.
//
// Who answered is kept on disk as well (affinity.json, next to the
// providers), so a restart — an update's included — doesn't hand a
// conversation to whoever routing puts first while the vendor still has
// it cached at the one before (vincentzhang on Discord).
