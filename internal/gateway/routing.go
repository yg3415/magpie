// Routing spreads a provider's requests over the keys or accounts it has
// on (see provider.Provider.Routing): smartly, in order, in turn, or the
// least used first. Whichever goes first, a key that suits the request
// still goes before one that doesn't, and one resting after a failure
// waits at the back for as long as its failure says: out of credit for
// half an hour, out of quota until it says it resets — or, for a
// subscription, until the window it filled does — rate limited until it
// says to try again, and otherwise a minute, longer each time it fails
// again. A rest's length and what set it go into the trace as they are, so
// what the Routing page says is when the account really comes back.
