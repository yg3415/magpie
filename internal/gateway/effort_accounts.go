// An account's plan may not take every reasoning level its model has: a
// Free ChatGPT account turns gpt-6-luna at high and above away with a 400,
// which a Plus one beside it answers (#520). Such an account is asked
// after its provider's others that may take the level — by its own model
// list's levels, or what it answered last — and one that refuses the level
// is not the request's fault: the next is asked, and it doesn't rest. When
// none that is left takes it, the agent is told so, not the level lowered
// behind its back.
