// Routing, live: the gateway's own trace of each request, played as it
// happens. A magpie carries each request from its agent through magpie to
// the account routing put first; another brings the answer back — or,
// from one that can't answer, the failure back to magpie, and the first
// takes the request on to the next. Every agent sending at once plays at
// once, each from its own place on the left. Every row, number and sentence comes from what the gateway
// recorded while deciding (see internal/gateway/trace.go) — the order it
// weighed the accounts in, what it weighed them by, what each answered,
// how long a failed one rests. Nothing here is worked out again or made up.
